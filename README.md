# Web Portfolio - README

## Introduction

This web portfolio represents my ongoing journey and growth as a Junior Software Developer. Following the completion of my bootcamp, I’ve continued to expand my skills and knowledge, applying new technologies and concepts to showcase my projects. This portfolio not only highlights the work I’ve done but also serves as a platform for me to explore and integrate new technologies, demonstrating my continuous learning and development. The project is built with a modern stack of technologies to ensure a rich and interactive experience across various devices.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Models**: The portfolio features an engaging 3D scene with an island and animated elements that respond to user interactions. This is implemented using **Three.js** and **@react-three/fiber** for rendering the 3D content, making the experience visually appealing and immersive.
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions and animations throughout the portfolio are handled using **Framer Motion**, providing smooth and visually appealing effects that enhance the user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices. This is achieved with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a consistent look and feel across platforms.

- **Email Integration**: The portfolio includes a contact form that uses **EmailJS** to send messages directly from the site, allowing visitors to easily get in touch with me.

- **TypeScript**: The project is built with **TypeScript**, adding type safety and improving code quality by catching potential errors early during development.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React.js**: The foundation of the project, providing a powerful and flexible framework for building the user interface.
- **Three.js**: Used for rendering the 3D models, creating a rich and interactive visual experience.
- **@react-three/fiber**: A React renderer for Three.js, enabling the integration of 3D content into React components.
- **@react-three/drei**: A helper library for Three.js, offering pre-built components and utilities to streamline the development of 3D scenes.
- **Framer Motion**: Handles animations and transitions, ensuring smooth and dynamic interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling, providing a responsive and modern design out of the box.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances the developer experience by preventing common coding errors.

### Development Tools

- **Vite**: A fast and efficient build tool that powers the development and bundling process.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in the code, maintaining a consistent code style.
- **PostCSS**: A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins, enhancing the development process.
- **EmailJS**: Facilitates sending emails directly from the website without needing a backend.

## How It Works

The portfolio features an interactive 3D scene, which users can explore by rotating the island model. Different sections of the portfolio are revealed as the island rotates to specific angles. Each section offers information about me, my skills, my projects, and a contact option. The smooth animations and transitions make navigating through the portfolio enjoyable and intuitive.
